            Statistics show that nearly 59% of people would not feel confident enough to try to save a life and 24% would do nothing and wait for an ambulance to arrive. That is why first aid is a really important set of skills to have, because knowing how to properly provide first aid can save someone’s life. Simply by knowing how to provide first aid properly, 2,500 lives could have been saved each year.</p></h3>

                           <p> It may be difficult to breathe and their throat and tongue may be swollen. Check if the person carries any medication with them and if you are trained, give the medication to them, if not then try to help administer their medication. Also make sure they are sitting upright (if they are conscious), since it is the best position to breathe properly while having an allergic reaction.</p>

                            Chest pain (usually located in the centre of the chest)<br>

                            Try to sit the person down. If they are conscious give them a 300 mg aspirin tablet to chew slowly. If the person becomes unconscious open their airway, check their breathing and if necessary start CPR</p>
